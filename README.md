# Modeling of circuits for Build-A-Cell interlab integration study
There are two projects :
* Input focused : Modeling a synthetic biological circuit that takes in multiple types of inputs to a logic gate circuit and gives a fluorescent protein output.
* Output focused : Modeling a synthetic vesicle system where two vesicles are inducibly merged together to express a fluorescent protein.

The modeling uses tools such as [Sub-SBML](https://github.com/buildacell/subsbml), [bioCRNpyler](https://github.com/BuildACell/BioCRNPyler), [bioscrape](https://github.com/ananswam/bioscrape/), [RoadRunner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/roadrunner/) and all models are written in SBML.
